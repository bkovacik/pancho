we're using mingw-w64 (http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds)

LIB_DIR = mingw64\lib
INC_DIR = mingw64\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\4.9.2\include

download glfw (https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.1.1/glfw-3.1.1.bin.WIN64.zip)
put the .a's from lib-mingw in LIB_DIR
put GLFW folder in INC_DIR

download glew (https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.12.0/glew-1.12.0-win32.zip/download)
put glew32s.lib (can be found in lib\Release\x64) in LIB_DIR
put GL folder in INC_DIR

download zlib and libpng (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxI_Tbj2QWS3WVhuTmZaRnVzdDA/view?usp=sharing)
put the .a's in LIB_DIR
put the .h's in INC_DIR

download openALsoft (http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-soft-1.16.0-bin.zip)
rename the .dll.a to libOpenAL32.a (found in libs/Win64) and put in LIB_DIR
rename soft_oal.dll (found in bin/Win64) to OpenAL32.dll and put it in System32
put the entire AL folder in INC_DIR

run cmakemake.bat
if all goes well you should find a pancho.exe in your code folder. If not, something probably went wrong.

for tiles that need to be lined up and tiled seamlessly, they must have 1 pixel border that correctly interpolates between it and neighboring tiles. the tile is still read without the 1 pixel border.

I get a warning "corrupt .drectve at end of def file." This seems not to affect the program, but I am currently waiting on a more definitive answer.

I had to compile zlib/libpng myself, so hopefully it works for you guys as well.
